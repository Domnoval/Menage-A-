1. Core UX Philosophy (This Replaces “User-Centered Design”)

The interface is not the destination.
It is the condition under which ideas appear.

Users are not customers.
They are participants.

The app does not teach.
It does not optimize engagement.
It creates a perceptual moment.

2. The Golden Rule of Interaction

Nothing should demand attention.
Everything should reward it.

If a UI element:

flashes

nags

auto-plays aggressively

forces a funnel

It’s out.

Discovery should feel:

voluntary

earned

slightly intimate

3. Cognitive Load Strategy (Very Important)
Default State

Calm

Sparse

Low-information density

Progressive Reveal

Complexity unfolds only after interaction

No info dumps

No walls of controls

Think:

A dim room where lights turn on because you moved, not because you were told to.

4. Navigation Model (Non-Linear by Default)

Linear menus = bureaucratic thinking.

Preferred metaphors:

Nodes

Constellations

Stacks

Layers

Portals

Navigation should feel like:

Exploring a system, not completing a checklist.

Users should be able to:

enter from multiple points

leave without penalty

return without punishment

No “you missed this” anxiety.

5. Interface as Instrument, Not Dashboard

Buttons are fine.
Sliders are fine.
Controls are fine.

But they should feel like:

tuning

adjusting

modulating

Not:

managing

configuring

administrating

Think:

Synthesizer, not spreadsheet.

6. Visual Hierarchy Rules

Space > Elements
Empty space is active. It signals intention.

One Primary Focus Per Screen
If everything is important, nothing is.

Secondary Actions Are De-Emphasized
No visual shouting.

Motion Is Meaningful

Appears = intention

Moves = relationship

Fades = completion

Never decorative motion. Ever.

7. Color & Light in UI

Color is semantic, not aesthetic.

Neutral base = mental clarity

Accent color = event, state change, or emphasis

One accent at a time

Light/dark mode is not just preference:

Dark = introspective / immersive

Light = analytical / reflective

Apps may even shift modes contextually 👀

8. Typography in Interfaces

Type should feel:

readable at a glance

calm over long exposure

neutral enough to host meaning

Rules:

Fewer fonts

Clear hierarchy

Generous line spacing

Text is not decoration.
It’s a delivery mechanism for thought.

9. Interaction Feedback (Subtle but Satisfying)

Every action should respond, but quietly:

soft haptics

micro-animations

slight delays (intentional, not laggy)

Feedback should say:

“Yes, something happened.”
Not:
“LOOK AT ME WORKING.”

10. Onboarding Philosophy (Anti-Onboarding)

No tutorials unless absolutely necessary.

Preferred:

contextual hints

first-time micro-prompts

learning by touching

If you must explain:

one sentence

optional

dismissible forever

Curiosity beats instruction.

11. Error States & Empty States

Empty ≠ broken.

Empty states should feel like:

potential

readiness

quiet

Errors should be:

human

non-judgmental

reversible

No red panic energy unless something is truly on fire.

12. AI & Generative Elements (If / When Used)

AI is not the star.
It is a collaborator in the background.

No “AI did this” hype

No anthropomorphizing

No fake magic

The result matters, not the tool.

13. The Ultimate UX Test

Ask this after designing any screen:

“Does this make someone feel more capable of thought…
or more managed?”

If it feels managerial, cut it.

14. Translation Rule (Continuity Across Mediums)

An interaction should feel conceptually the same whether it’s:

a mobile app

a desktop tool

a website

an installation

Same idea.
Different embodiment.
